“The creator economy is becoming part of the cryptoeconomy. Because legacy social media platforms have no real concept of digital property rights.” (Balajis)

The ages-old debate on new forms of art and how they fit in the history of human culture has found another node around which new and old issues have been recently clustering. Moreover, the debate itself on whether we are actually dealing with a new art form or not can be mapped into the theme I am about to discuss, even if the actors involved do not seem themselves that concerned about it at the moment.

This is due, I believe, to the fact that the problem of so-called "traditional art" *versus* digital art has already been discussed to death and nobody seems to have been able to settle the question for good. Still, artists on both sides of the divide eventually went on with their businesses regardless (for a general overview of it made in the immediate aftermath of the debate, see Heller: Educ of Illustrator).

To make matters simpler, let us define some terms and parameters so that we can have a working knowledge upon which to build this conversation. First, I will take the visual arts, more specifically art in the form of images (either static or animated), as my point of departure. For our purposes, digital art comprises images *created* or at least finalized through digital means, ranging from algorithmic or self-generated images--abstract or otherwise--, to realistic pieces made with the input of an artist's manual gestures identical to pencil strokes on an electronic device or even started on paper or some other physical medium, but then further developed through digital means. Granted, the distinction can sometimes get blurry, but let's avoid splitting hairs here: I will draw the line by saying that a work all done on physical means, then photographed or scanned and treated just so that it looks better--sharper colors, more contrast etc.--does not count as digital art. The fact that a finished work of digital art is, when all is said and done, a file, a plain and simple JPEG or perhaps an MP3 file in the case of music, is what really matters. The problem it poses is that there is no intrinsic difference between a piece of digital art and a copy of it. To put it bluntly, it's as if there was no original object... An old theme that can feel almost fresh depending on how one looks at it: after all, sculptures are made from molds; studies, copies and replicas of masterpieces populate art academies since forever; and photography has had to deal with this conundrum since its inception (REFERENCIAS). We will get back to this shortly.

Leaving art aside for a brief moment, let's talk about this NFT thing in its fundamental dimension. Even if they are arguably becoming progressively rarer, cash bills are the commonest example of a fungible thing with which we deal in everyday life: a one dollar bill is essentially worth the same as another one dollar bill. One can be in better shape than the other, but as long as it is not beaten to the point of being irrecognizable, it will still be accepted everywhere and will buy anything that another one dollar bill can buy. The same goes for cryptocurrencies, even if it is harder to think about it thoroughly due to their inherent immateriality. But let's imagine the following situation: a trader has bought 200 dollars worth of Bitcoin when its price was 40k. Then the price starts to drop and the trader panic-sells at 38k, getting 190 dollars in return and watching BTC go way down to 33k. When the coin starts to pump again, greed kicks in and our trader buys 200 dolars again at 35k, expecting it to keep going up and make up for the previous loss and perhaps take some profit now. The story could get spicier with the right dose of "hopium", meme coins, and Twitter celebrities, but what matters here is that our trader does not care at all if the 200 dollars worth of BTC they bought back at 35k are the same BTC they previously had. On the contrary, the very fact that we are dealing with a fungible thing has a connection with the reality that the trader entered the position first with 200 dollars turned into 0.005 BTC, exited when these were worth 190 dolars at 38k, then got in again at 35k with 200 dollars that afforded them 0.00571428 BTC that would become around 228 dollars if and when BTC got back to 40k.

When we switch the conversation to Non-Fungible Tokens we are dealing with a different beast in the sense that each token is unique and this is what defines them. For the sake of this conversation, we are treating tokens and coins interchangeably (FOR A CLARIFICATION, SEE BINANCE ACADEMY). For our purposes, a token is any asset that is issued by or circulates in a project, that functions as a means of payment, but also has other properties. To give an example that will become useful down the road, as someone put it, a ticket to a concert "is a ‘real-life token’ — you may use it at a certain time, at a certain place. You can’t go to the restaurant and pay your bill with concert ticket — ticket has its value only at concert hall. Digital tokens…” — @bonpay https://link.medium.com/Y7DrXe40Whb. So, a Non-Fungible Token (NFT for short) is a token that, even if identical to another one to the naked eye, is unique on a deeper level. This uniqueness, then, this "deeper level" can be in extreme cases, the cryptographic hash of a file and only that. The ramifications and possibilities opened by such technology are huge

This is why NFTs are being touted as a means to create 

 The discussion of new and old art forms appears here transformed due to the very nature of the problems at hand, and tracing a comparison--even if a non-exhaustive one--between NFTs and so-called "traditional art" in the back of our minds while discussing what is going on in digital art at the moment can be useful down the line.

	⁃	arquivo digital: copia vs og
	⁃	discussão sobre escassez na arte digital (aquele artigo que não consigo mais achar, mas talvez tenha sido o que o Andre Nahoum me mandou) - VOLTAREI A ELA NO FINAL
	⁃	daí entrar num histórico de cripto-arte
	⁃	entrar no NFT craze - paralelo bull market
	⁃	Checar a história do Burnt Banksy - a performance foi vendida como NFT
	⁃	relação com o Art World:
	⁃	ART world hates NFTs
	⁃	I like it bc it’s shaking things
	⁃	I like it bc it’s less competition - the ones who make a lot are not there yet 
	⁃	Compara com a guitarra elétrica: aliás podemos tocar, são novos sons, rock and roll nasce etc. 
	⁃	Depois tem algo com o Elon Musk e o Beeple
	⁃	E tem tb o Jack Dorsey ter minted o primeiro Tweet dele - discussão sobre ricos que não precisam desse dinheiro ganharem fortunas com isso
	⁃	falar da relação com as criptomoedas - principalmente as críticas (ambientais e especulação)
	⁃	o comentário do cara no CH sobre muito “whataboutism” - toda a questão da caixa preta que são as outras coisas
	⁃	o AA falando que PoW é o que é sabido de ser seguro e por isso ele apoia
	⁃	muito whataboutism:
	⁃	Contexto COVID: Numa sala sobre ComiCons terem sido canceladas, saiu o assunto de NFT e um membro disse que era esperado
	⁃	eles dizem que não estão fazendo dinheiro sem as ComiCons (não ir a uma dessas é leave money on the table e eles chegavam a mandar amigos e familiares em seu lugar para poderem ir a vários ao mesmo tempo) e que NFT ter surgido justamente numa época como essa da pandemia foi uma saída importante
	⁃	Most stats don’t take into consideration the true impact: people won’t be getting their cars to go to the banks working; most miners are using renewables; it’s in transition, but i wouldn’t buy too much into it; there are much more pressing concerns in this world than having fun with your crypto; so deal with this unwound look for stats that would show other harms to the environment; it’s like when people get mad about food stamps - that’s why we pay taxes -, but those are a drop in the bucket compared to companies and corporations that don’t pay their taxes. 

	⁃	no fim das contas, artistas tendo que achar plataformas ambientalmente corretas para não serem cancelados (checar o tweet que salvei do Bobby Chiu, que apanhou feio)
	⁃	tem gente falando isso explicitamente: artistas têm que fazer pq senão vão ser cancelados


A discussão sobre escassez e implicações da criptoarte

Provenance vs uniqueness
	⁃	bom tema: todo mundo pensa só na unicidade, mas o que substituiu todo o trabalho que os curadores fazem de registrar a proveniência das obras é um tema interessante 
	⁃	scarcity vs reprodutibility (reprodutibility is the only thing we’ve got)

Observações:
	⁃	tendência à futurologia
	⁃	futurologia muita sobreposição com AR e VR: decentraland, galerias virtuais (alguns associam à situação com a COVID)
	⁃	“we’re in the dawn of a second Renaissance”
	⁃	“completely new model for patronage and for us to work the way we want to be working”
	⁃	ver NFT como uma forma de “break away from client work and do art for yourself, what you want to do”
	⁃	questão ambiental ignorada pela maioria das pessoas
	⁃	não se toca no assunto a maior parte do tempo e sempre vem uma pessoa para levantar
	⁃	aí aparecem pessoas desdizendo
	⁃	alguns falam de FUD e de medo de afastar pessoas de algo que seria bom e das virtudes do modelo (descentralização)
	⁃	elogiando PoW: it’s not that it’s doing nothing: it’s working for the system’s security - that’s part of the value!; transition to PoS has tradeoffs, is not proven tech
	⁃	cabe perguntar o que é segurança nesse caso e qual o valor dessa segurança? Não há certa miopia aí em garantir segurança em um sistema que destroi o entorno
	⁃	sentimento de Gold Rush:
	⁃	some opportunity in this rapidly closing windows
	⁃	NFTs give power and leverage to artists
	⁃	a definitive push towards animation in illustration- ver foto do velho fim fogo em volta na minha galeria
	⁃	Importância de ajudar os artistas; tratar isso como uma comunidade que tem que se apoiar (vincular à coisa insana do Twitter)
	⁃	Muito estímulo para comprarem NFTs, pra criar um marketplace 
	⁃	Forma de fugir das outras formas de financiamento (inclusive Patreon)
	⁃	Artistas querendo vender para poderem mint outras obras - custo do Gas 

SOLUCOES PARA MÜSICOS
Mintar partes de músicas - Phonogram.me mintando solos, linhas de baixo, viradas de bateria, o cara ontem no CH mintando trecho tb e dando early-access to a song that would be available on Spotify in two weeks: he says these are two different revenue models that he works on in parallel
